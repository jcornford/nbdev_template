    "The repo is built based on nbdev template https://github.com/fastai/nbdev with some modifications. Follow these instructions to get set up:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Set up virtualenv\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently I'm assuming this repo will be worked on in combination with the MILA server, so I've made a requirements file for a virtual env to be combined with the loadable modules on the server for a general ML env (can add to the env as needed). \n",
    "\n",
    "The command/combination to load modules that work at the moment is\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ module load python/3.7 cuda/10.1 cuda/10.1/cudnn/7.6 python/3.7/cuda/10.1/cudnn/7.6/pytorch/1.5.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note you may need to \"module unload anaconda\" first. Also, I was having problems with certain nodes and cuda versions, hence why not I'm not using default \"module load pytorch\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Next is to set up the virtual env. Create the env by running the following in the project root (where the requirements.txt file is)\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ virtualenv env\n",
    "$ source env/bin/activate\n",
    "$ pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "The folder env already exists and contains a gitignore file preventing contents from being tracked by git. Rename the folder or copy the file if you want a different env name. \n",
    "\n",
    "From then on just activate the env, e.g:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ source env/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Set up nbdev\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detail check out the offical tutorials e.g https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorial/. The no.1 thing is to run\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ nbdev_install_git_hooks\n",
    "```\n",
    "in the environment. Not sure if you need to do this within the repo but I did... You should get a some confirmation message. This will set up git hooks which will remove metadata from your notebooks when you commit, greatly reducing the chance of a conflict. \n",
    "\n",
    "If there is a conflict later, run **nbdev_fix_merge filename.ipynb**. This replaces any conflicts in cell outputs with your version, and if there are conflicts in input cells, then both cells will be included in the merged file, along with standard conflict markers (e.g. =====). Then you can open the notebook in Jupyter and choose which version to keep.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Set up MILA jupyterhub\n",
    "\n",
    "We just need to get jupyterhub to place nicely with the virtualenv environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to load the modules by clicking the blue hexagon on the right of the jupyterhub page. Load the same modules as the above, and can save this selection with the floppy disk symbol for faster loading next time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Install a kernel for the notebooks. If using the requirements.txt file, the enviroment should already have ipykernel installed, if not \"pip install ipykernel\". Then \"ipython kernel install --user --name=kaggle_kernel\". Run these with the environment activated"
